SHOOTING METHOD:

There will be two motors and a pinch (Solenoid). The pinch will restrict the rope to one way movement (move catapult down)
while activated. Then, when the pinch is deactivated, it will be able to move the catapult up.

The first motor will move the rope back, pulling the catapult arm back. To shoot, the first motor will pull the catapult
all the way back, activate the pinch, the first motor will unwind the rope, then the pinch will deactivate allowing
the rope to move through quickly.

The second motor will adjust where the catapult will stop when the rope moves up to shoot so we can adjust whether we want
a lob or a shot at the goal.

In addition, the encoder for the first motor (the one that winds back) is not located on the motor itself, but
on the catapult arm, so we will be able to tell the position of the arm and the angle/orientation it is at.
