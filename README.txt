--  III. Guidelines for Committing                               --
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Commit self-contained changes.  You're not the only one using
   this code.  If you have a single commit that makes a bunch of
   unrelated changes, it's a lot of work to merge.

2. Use descriptive commit information.  Git is tricky, and it's
   much harder when you have to dive into each commit to figure out
   what it's doing.

3. Make branches when appropriate.  If you're making major
   architectural changes to the code, or prototyping a major
   feature that needs testing before it should be integrated into
   production code, make a branch!  Once the branch is considered
   stable, it can be merged with a single commit.  Another use
   case for branches is when testing multiple methods of solving a
   problem: the one method that is chosen can be integrated
   without polluting the codebase with alternatives.
