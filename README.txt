-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. If you have not set-up WindRiver, follow the Getting Started
   With C++ guide from FIRST
   (http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/3120/m/7913)

2. Import the Robot-2014 project into WindRiver
   [File->Import...  General->Existing Project Into Workspace]
   Select the project directory with "Select Root Directory"
   Do not Copy the Project into the Workspace

3. Build the project once
   [CTRL+B CTRL+P]

4. Change your FIRST Downloader Preferences to download this 
   project
   [Window->Preferences  First Downloader Preferences]
   Set Team Number to 3130
   Set the download file to the .out file from the project (found 
   in Robot-2014/PPC603gnu/Robot-2014/Debug)

--  III. Guidelines for Committing                               --
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Commit self-contained changes.  You're not the only one using
   this code.  If you have a single commit that makes a bunch of
   unrelated changes, it's a lot of work to merge.

2. Use descriptive commit information.  Git is tricky, and it's
   much harder when you have to dive into each commit to figure out
   what it's doing.

3. Make branches when appropriate.  If you're making major
   architectural changes to the code, or prototyping a major
   feature that needs testing before it should be integrated into
   production code, make a branch!  Once the branch is considered
   stable, it can be merged with a single commit.  Another use
   case for branches is when testing multiple methods of solving a
   problem: the one method that is chosen can be integrated
   without polluting the codebase with alternatives.
